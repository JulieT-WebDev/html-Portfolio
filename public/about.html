<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a motivated and adaptable professional preparing for a career as a full-stack developer, 
  with a strong foundation in instructional design and a passion for building user-focused digital experiences.

<p>Before diving into web development, I spent several years designing and delivering learning solutions 
that helped teams grow and perform at their best. I’ve created interactive eLearning courses, job aids, and 
training resources using tools like Articulate Storyline, Rise 360, SnagIt, and Camtasia—always with a focus on clarity, 
accessibility, and learner engagement. I also have experience supporting remote teams, supervising instructional projects, 
and collaborating with stakeholders across departments.</p>

<p>Now, I'm channeling that same problem-solving mindset into web development. I’ve already built a solid foundation 
in HTML and CSS, and I’m expanding into JavaScript (ES6), DOM manipulation, Git/GitHub, and responsive design with Flexbox, 
Grid, and Bootstrap 5. On the back end, I’m learning Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and RESTful APIs, and I’m exploring React.js 
and authentication workflows to build full-stack applications from the ground up.</p>

<p>I bring a unique blend of learning experience design and technical development, and I’m committed to continuous growth. 
Whether I’m coding a website or creating a course, I care deeply about usability, structure, and delivering a seamless experience 
for the end user.</p>
